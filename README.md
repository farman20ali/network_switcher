# Network Switcher Tray App

A simple Linux system tray application to quickly switch between network modes (Wi-Fi, Wired, Both, Hotspot, or disable all) using NetworkManager (`nmcli`).

## Features
- System tray icon with menu for network switching
- Supports Wi-Fi, Wired, Both, Hotspot, and disabling all connections
- Shows current connection status in the menu
- Graceful exit and tray icon removal on Ctrl+C or SIGTERM
- Uses Unicode icons for menu items (can be customized)

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- NetworkManager (`nmcli` command-line tool)
- Python packages:
  - pystray
  - pillow

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pystray pillow
```

## Usage

### Method 1: Running Manually
1. Place your network icon as `network_icon.png` in the project directory (64x64 PNG recommended).
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x network_switcher.py
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   ./network_switcher.py
   ```
   Or run in the background:
   ```bash
   nohup ./network_switcher.py </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```

### Method 2: Running as a Systemd Service (Recommended)
1. Create the systemd user service directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/
   ```

2. Copy the service file to the systemd directory:
   ```bash
   cp network-switcher.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
   ```

3. Reload systemd configuration:
   ```bash
   systemctl --user daemon-reload
   ```

4. Enable the service to start on login:
   ```bash
   systemctl --user enable network-switcher.service
   ```

5. Start the service:
   ```bash
   systemctl --user start network-switcher.service
   ```

To check the service status:
```bash
systemctl --user status network-switcher.service
```

To view logs:
```bash
journalctl --user -u network-switcher.service -f
```

To stop the service:
```bash
systemctl --user stop network-switcher.service
```

## Menu Options
- üì∂ Switch to Wi-Fi
- üåê Switch to Wired
- üîÑ Enable Both Wi-Fi and Wired
- üì° Turn On Hotspot
- ‚ùå Stop All Connections
- Quit

The current connection status is displayed at the top of the menu.

## Notes
- The script dynamically detects your Ethernet and Hotspot connection names. If your system uses custom names, edit the detection logic as needed.
- Unicode icons may not display on all system trays. You can change them to plain text or small images in the code.
- Logging is set to stdout by default. For persistent logs, edit the logging configuration in the script.
- The network_icon.png file must be in the same directory as the script.
